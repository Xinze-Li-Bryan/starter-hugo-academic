Hi! I am Xinze, a PhD student at the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.toronto.edu/cms/) of the University of Toronto. My research interests lie in the differential geometry, an area of studying geometric shapes via calculus type analytic tools such as partial differential equation and geometric measure theory. During my undergraduate time, I was very glad to be supervised by professor [Yevgeny Liokumovich](https://www.math.toronto.edu/ylio/) and joint worked with [Bruno Staffa](http://www.math.toronto.edu/cms/people/students/graduate/staffa-bruno/)
