Hi! I am Xinze, a Ph.D. student at the [Department of Mathematics of the University of Toronto](https://www.mathematics.utoronto.ca/). My research interests lie in differential geometry, an area of studying geometric shapes via calculus-type analytic tools such as partial differential equations and geometric measure theory.
