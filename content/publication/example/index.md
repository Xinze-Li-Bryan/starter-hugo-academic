abstract: We show that given a closed n-manifold M, for a generic set of
  Riemannian metrics g on M there exists a sequence of closed geodesics that are
  equidistributed in M if n=2; and an equidistributed sequence of embedded
  stationary geodesic nets if n=3. One of the main tools that we use is the Weyl
  Law for the volume spectrum for 1-cycles, proved by Liokumovich, Marques and
  Neves for n=2 and more recently by Guth and Liokumovich for n=3. We show that
  our proof of the equidistribution of geodesic nets can be generalized for any
  dimension nâ‰¥2 provided the Weyl Law for 1-cycles in n-manifolds holds.
